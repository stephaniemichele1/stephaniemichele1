- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on going to college online to get a Bachelor's in Psychology. I also have like 4 different kinds of bussiness's that I am trying to start and get running. I'm sure if I would just focus on just one at a time, I would be more successful then attempting to start all of them at once with each of them so different from each other.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of different things. Besides the Psychology, I am taking courses to learn how to code in SQL and Python at the moment. I will also start courses in November for IT Support. I love the AI technology. I also love learning and want to learn anything and everything I can, especially if I find it interesting.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on, well actually I would just love to watch and learn everything I can from everyone. I am like a spounge and I take it all in.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with trying to figure out if it's possible to build an App or website, possibly even a generative AI, to help me design and customize coloring pages to make into a book to sell. I know I would love to get a customized coloring book anytime. But it could make a kid's day great also. Or if its something that could even be possible and what direction to point me in to figuring out how to do it.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anuthing. I am an open book but you just have to ask.
